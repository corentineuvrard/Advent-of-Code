# 🎄 Advent of Code 🎄

### Welcome to my Advent of Code repository!

Every December, developers worldwide tackle coding challenges from Advent of Code,
a daily series of puzzles that stretch your problem-solving skills and creativity.<br>
It's a festive tradition that combines learning, fun, and programming excellence.

### ✨ About Advent of Code

Advent of Code is an annual event featuring 25 programming puzzles, one for each day leading up to Christmas.<br>
Challenges range from algorithmic exercises to decoding real-world problems — all wrapped in delightful,
holiday-themed stories.

You can solve the puzzles in any programming language, at your own pace, and compare solutions with others.<br>
It’s a perfect opportunity to hone your coding skills and share the joy of problem-solving with the community!

### 🌟 A note about my Advent of Code journey

I **love** the spirit of Advent of Code — the festive themes, the brain-twisting puzzles,
and the chance to sharpen my coding skills.<br>
But let’s be real: my participation is... *delightfully chaotic*.<br>
Some years, I’m all in, solving puzzles daily like a coding elf on a caffeine high.<br>
Other years? Let’s just say my sleigh takes a detour.

Still, every puzzle I tackle is a blast, and I keep coming back because it’s just that much fun. 🎄

### 📣 Shoutout to the Creator

Thanks to [Eric Wastl](https://was.tl) for creating this amazing event every year!
